                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>Tetra was struggling with their existing UX. It was time-consuming, fragmented, and inefficient, leading to challenges in managing and organizing research studies, recruiting participants, analyzing data, and collaborating with colleagues. Users needed a comprehensive and streamlined platform that simplifies the research process, improves efficiency.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box title-text-pair">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>We designed and developed a comprehensive platform that addresses specific user needs such as providing a user-friendly interface to manage, organize and share insights from research studies, scheduling and participating in user interviews and more. We also designed new design language in combination with a scalable and modular design system.</p>

        <p>Research was crucial to take informed decisions later on. By understanding user needs and goals, we were able to design a platform that meets and solves specific needs in a streamlined and efficient user experience. 
            We categorized our learnings in the following buckets:</p>

            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p class="p-space">
                Unlike traditional relational databases, Redis offers built-in data types such as lists, hashes and strings to store related data. Similar to how a kids fit shape game organizes various shapes to fit into corresponding holes, Redis data types allow for a quick and simple organization of different types of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Redis logo incorporates the shape fitment metaphor to capture the versatility and playful nature of Redis, while also incorporating the classic disc stack shape to represent its function as a database.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box box2 title-text-pair">
            <h3>Anatomy</h3>
            <p class="p-space">
                The Redis logo is composed by two main components, the Redis emblem on the left, which is an isometric representation of the Redis brand concept, and the wordmark on the right, to communicate the brand name.               
            </p>
            <p>
                The typography is a rounded sans-serif font, which reinforces the playful and friendliness nature of Redis. The color palette is predominantly composed of shades of red as primary color, followed by gray and white as secondaries, making the Redis logo different from other databases logos, which usually use blue.

        <h3>Accesible design language.</h3>
        <p>To achieve this, I made multiple iterations and revisions of my designs, creating prototypes along the way to test out different ideas. Some design decisions were even A/B tested to ensure that the final product would be user-friendly and visually appealing. Through this process, I was able to create Hi-Fi designs that not only were aligned with the AT&T brand but also introduced a fresh and modern look for the IoT platform.</p>
