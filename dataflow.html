                <p>AT&T saw an opportunity to empower both startups and large enterprises to swiftly design, build, and bring to market advanced connected device solutions. By building an open platform that enabled end-to-end connected device solutions on a global scale, AT&T aimed to provide a comprehensive solution for companies looking to enter the IoT market.</p>

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>In collaboration with the TheoremOne team, we designed, built and delivered an intuitive IoT platform accesible to large enterprises and startups. In tandem, we also created a scalable design system to support the platform needs, as well as other parts of the experience such as the landing website & IoT marketplace. </p>

            <h3>Discovery & Ideation</h3>
            <p>I was part of a cross-functional team composed of very talented product managers, UX researchers, and Front-End & Back-end engineers. This allowed us to work collaboratively at every phase of the project.</p> <p>First, we worked to define how our team was going to work together. All projects are different and unique, so it was important to define the roles and responsibilities of each team member. We also established clear goals and timelines for the project.
                To ensure that we were on the same page as the client, we held a workshop to review the scope of the project and identify the specific requirements and potential pain points and we prioritized them into must haves, nice to haves and less important.

        <p>Additionally, we conducted thorough research (qualitative & quantitative), created mood boards, and conducted card sorting exercises to map out the information architecture. All of these efforts were necessary to set a solid foundation for the project and have a clear vision for the solution.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <p class="p-space">With the learnings gained during the discovery phase, we quickly created wireframes for how a MVP could look like. After several rounds of revisions and testing we were able to consolidate flows for the core features. A registry to manage all your IoT devices, the project editor to build your solutions, the auth system (integrated with GitHub), a notification system and more.</p>
            <p>This was the perfect time to run usability tests and validate our assumptions. Fortunately, the feedback was positive and revealed small issues that lead to improvements. One example is how we moved from a single column design to a two column in the device registry page. This enabled the users not only so switch and check statuses of multiple IoT devices quickly but to also bulk edit multiple devices at once.</p></div>

        <p class="p-space">While staying true to the existing AT&T brand guidelines, the goal was also to create a new design system that would support all the new elements needed for this platform.</p>
        <p>To achieve this, I made multiple iterations and revisions of my designs, creating prototypes along the way to test out different ideas. Some design decisions were even A/B tested to ensure that the final product would be user-friendly and visually appealing. Through this process, I was able to create Hi-Fi designs that not only were aligned with the AT&T brand but also introduced a fresh and modern look for the IoT platform.</p>

            <h3>Scalable, thoughtful and cohesive.</h3>
            <p>Back in September of 2017, and almost at the same time we were starting to work on AT&T IoT Platform UI, Figma released the 1.0 version of their team library feature. It was perfect timing to start building AT&T's first design system in Figma. Leveraging the existing AT&T brand, design language, and style guide, we set out on the journey to expand and create new components to fulfill the needs of the IoT platform.
                The result was a high quality scalable system inline with AT&T’s design language..</p>

                    During the course of the project, we encountered various constraints that required the team to adapt our approach and prioritize the key features that were essential for the success of the project.</p>
